# Microservices Playground

## Description

Simple microservice application built with [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet).

It's only purpose was to get me familiar with basic concepts of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and Async Communication between microservices using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

I also made a SPA to recap [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Starting up the backend using Kubernetes

**Warning!** If you decide to run this application, be aware that afterwards you-ll have to delete manually all the deployments and services generated by these Kubernetes files. And most likely you-ll want to delete all the images pulled from Docker Hub.

```bash

$ cd K8S/

$ kubectl apply -f rabbitmq-depl.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f platform-depl.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f command-depl.yaml

```

You could now just go to Swagger UI and play around but it would be a better experience if you will do that through the frontend application.

- Platform Service Swagger UI http://localhost:5000/swagger
- Command Service Swagger UI http://localhost:5500/swagger
- RabbitMQ Management Page http://localhost:15672

## Starting up the frontend application

```bash

$ cd angular-spa/

$ npm install

$ ng serve

```

You'll find it at http://localhost:4200

## Closing everything after you are done

Deleting all deployments

```bash

$ kubectl get deployments

$ kubectl delete deployments <deployment name>

```

Deleting all services

```bash

$ kubectl get services

$ kubectl delete services <service name>

```

**Good Luck!**
